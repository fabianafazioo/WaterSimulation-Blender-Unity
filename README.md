# WaterSimulation-Blender-Unity
This model simulates fluid dynamics in Blender using Mantaflow. Water flows through a cube and collides with pillar-like obstacles, forming a wave. The fluid is exported as Alembic and the environment as FBX, then imported into Unity using URP for real-time rendering and material control.
